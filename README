# Weather CLI App

A simple Python command-line application that fetches live weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a readable format.

## Features

- Get current weather for any city
- Shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition
- Handles invalid city input gracefully
- Robust error handling for:
  - API downtime
  - Invalid city names
  - No internet connection

## Project Plan / Thought Process

### Step 1: Choose Your Weather API
- Signed up for OpenWeatherMap free tier
- Tested API calls to understand endpoint structure
- Confirmed JSON response format

### Step 2: Set Up Development Environment
- Created a virtual environment (`venv`)
- Installed required Python libraries (`requests`)
- Set up project folder structure

### Step 3: Start Small â€“ Make First API Call
- Hard-coded a city name
- Fetched data using a GET request
- Printed raw JSON response to understand the data

### Step 4: Parse and Display Basic Data
- Extracted temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed
- Displayed the data in a clean, readable format in the terminal

### Step 5: Add User Input
- Used `input()` to accept city names dynamically
- Converted user input to title case to handle case insensitivity
- Handled invalid city names gracefully

### Step 6: Error Handling
- Checked for API errors or downtime
- Handled network errors like no internet connection or request timeout
- Used `try-except` blocks to catch exceptions
